I finnaly finished cleaning the data, I still cant believe that I went from having 1200 anime to 470, but now I have another problem, from that 470 anime 458 have fields with no information, some of them several but I think I can make a script that can fill them automatically, I tried but it didnt work, so I have to do it manually "yay"


now that I think abou it, the values of the scores of the anime are hard coded, what if the score changes
